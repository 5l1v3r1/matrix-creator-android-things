Matrix Creator-Android Things (ALPHA)
=====================================

This Android Things app runs basic tests for Matrix sensors and Everloop ring. 

**IMPORTANT**: Please, note that these samples are not necessarily the easiest way because
the Google Things source code and documentation has not been published or completed. The next documentation is a Alpha version.

**PLEASE**: support us with one vote on "documentation request issue" in this link: [issue #2](https://github.com/androidthings/sample-simplepio/issues/2)

Pre-requisites
--------------

- RaspberryPi 3
- Matrix Creator
- Android Studio 2.2+

#### Firmware installation

For now you can test Matrix Creator with Google Things, for this we need FPGA burner running from root privileges, for it please follow next steps:

On your pc:

1. Flashing rpi3 Google Things image and connect with it via adb. [more info](https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/raspberrypi.html#flashing_the_image)
2. Obtain root privileges:        `adb root`    (take some seconds)
3. Mount partions on write mode:  `adb remount`
4. Clone repository and submodules: 

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/matrix-io/matrix-creator-android-things.git`
    ```
5. Copy firmware, burner, flashing script, and sensors test:

    ```bash
    cd matrix-creator-android-things/firmware
    adb push matrix_system.bit /system/bin/
    adb push matrix-xc3sprog /system/bin/
    adb push matrix-firmware-loader.sh /system/bin/
    adb matrix-sensors-status /system/bin/
   ```
6. Programing FPGA (~1 minute for flashing):

    ```bash
    adb shell matrix-firmware-loader.sh
    ```
you get output like this:

    ```bash
    disable Matrix Creator microcontroller..done
    reconfigurate FPGA and Micro..
    DNA is 0x79ec27f5572e2dfd
    done
    ```
7. Testing FPGA status

   ```bash
   adb shell matrix-sensors-status
   ```
you get output like this:

   ```bash
   IMUY:-1.1e+02째 IMUR:0.26째     IMUP:1.2째
   HUMI:35%       HTMP:35째C      UVID:0.0032
   PRSS:74960     PrAL:2470.7    PrTP:32.562
   MCU :0x10      VER :0x161026
   ```
if you get sensors on 0, please repeat step 6.


**NOTE** if you shutdown your raspberryPi, please repeat steps: 2 and 6. (root and reprograming FPGA)

Run sensors and everloop demo application
-----------------------------------------

From this point your have a basic Google Things project, for launch Demo (MatrixCreatorGT app) please execute this from main directory:

```bash
    ./gradlew installDebug
    adb shell am start admobilize.matrix.gt/.MainActivity
```
on your adb logcat will obtain sensors status and everloop leds will be animated.

### (OPTIONAL) Contribute or build xc3sprog programer code

For build the lastest FPGA programmer you need NDK and run:

```bash
    ./scripts/build_xc3sprog.sh
```
you get output like this:

```bash
    ...
    Linking CXX executable xc3sprog
    [100%] Built target xc3sprog
    [ 82%] Built target xc3sproglib
    [100%] Built target xc3sprog
    Installing the project stripped...
    -- Install configuration: "Debug"
    -- Installing: /home/username/src/admobilize/matrix-things/android_lib/xc3sprog/bin/xc3sprog
```
Then repeat steps 2 and 3 (firmware installation section) and copy new programer:

```bash
    cp android_lib/xc3sprog/bin/xc3sprog firmware/matrix-xc3sprog
    adb push firmware/matrix-xc3sprog /system/bin/
```
